# @edwardseshoka/fixtures

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2b1f9d9: Rename `@edwardseshoka/fixtures` to `@edwardseshoka/samples` and expose contract factories instead of raw seeds.

  - The package now exports factories that return domain contracts: `createPublicWines(): WineContract[]` and `createDiscover(overrides?): DiscoverContract`. `createDiscover` composes the same `DiscoverContract` the backend serves; pass `{ wines }` to compose against real catalog data.
  - Raw seed JSON and the old `createDiscoverHomeResponseFromSeeds` / per-fixture exports are no longer part of the public surface; seed data moved from `src/seeds` to private `src/data`.

  Breaking: consumers replace `@edwardseshoka/fixtures` with `@edwardseshoka/samples` and switch from raw seeds to the factory functions.

### Major Changes

- 030694a: Establish the first stable shared package releases.

  This promotes the shared contracts, fixtures, and foundation packages to the
  `1.x` line so app repositories can consume backward-compatible minor and patch
  updates with a semver range like `^1.0.0`, while future breaking changes remain
  manual app upgrades.
