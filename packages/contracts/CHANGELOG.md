# @edwardseshoka/contracts

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2b1f9d9: Restructure contracts into per-domain subpaths and make discover a composition contract.

  - New subpaths: `/catalog`, `/provenance`, `/editorial`, `/events`, `/social` (plus existing `/discover`, `/member`). `WineContract` and friends move from the package root to `/catalog` — the root now exports only `ApiResponse` and `PaginationContract`.
  - `PaginationDTO` renamed to `PaginationContract`.
  - Discover rewritten to the two-tier `DiscoverContract` (`{ hero, sections }`). The hero is a featured domain entity (`wine | region | editorial`) and sections carry domain-contract arrays. The old card and view-shaped hero types (`RegionCard`, `DiscoverWineHero`, `stats`, `ctas`, etc.) are removed — presentation now lives on the client.

  Breaking: every import path changes. Consumers move `WineContract` to `@edwardseshoka/contracts/catalog`, replace `DiscoverHomeResponse`/cards with `DiscoverContract` + domain contracts, and rename `PaginationDTO`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d46851d: Add member profile contract under the `@edwardseshoka/contracts/member` subpath.

  Exposes `MemberContract`, `MemberProfileType`, `MemberContactMethod`,
  `SaveMemberProfileRequest`, `GetMemberProfileResponse`, and
  `SaveMemberProfileResponse` as the single source of truth for the
  `GET/POST /user/profile` endpoints, shared by the backend Lambda handlers and
  the frontend member-data layer (including the member repository app double).

### Major Changes

- 030694a: Establish the first stable shared package releases.

  This promotes the shared contracts, fixtures, and foundation packages to the
  `1.x` line so app repositories can consume backward-compatible minor and patch
  updates with a semver range like `^1.0.0`, while future breaking changes remain
  manual app upgrades.

## 0.1.0

### Initial release

- Added the initial Morara shared contracts package.
