## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6866050: Enrich discover so the Fade Yield home screen composes end-to-end.

  **contracts** — `EditorialContract` gains an optional `author?: TrustBylineContract`
  (the byline shown on every editorial card: name + verification mark or member
  status + role). Additive; no existing field changes.

  **samples (breaking — curation shape)** — the curation document now drives the
  funnel directly:

  - `CurationSection` is a discriminated union. `region_cards` / `producer_cards`
    are replaced by a single `doorway_cards` section that carries fully-curated
    browse doorways inline (`DiscoverDoorwayContract[]`) — regions, producers,
    curated collections and appellations, each with an editorial title, a curator
    byline and a navigable `target`. Consumers that composed doorways by deriving
    from region/producer refs must read the inline `doorways` instead.
  - Editorial fixtures gain author bylines; two events are added
    (`event_chenin_masterclass` — online / open, no seat cap; `event_cap_classique_brunch`
    — sold out) and the curation references all four, so the events rail and its
    seat states (open · seats-left · sold-out) are seeded.
  - Sections are ordered to the funnel (editorial · doorways · events · room); the
    `discover-response.json` fixture is updated to match (authors + four events).

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- e8c658f: Wine World Model + Fade Yield: evolve the shared contracts so the model understands wine globally and expresses the Fade Yield design — verdict words, provenance, trust bylines and member-note counts instead of public numeric scores.

  **Breaking — `contracts`**

  - Remove public numeric scores: `WineRatingContract`, `WineContract.rating`, `AddWineRequest.rating` and `ActivityContract.rating` are gone. Wines carry `verdict`, `provenance`, `source` and `noteCount` instead.
  - `VerdictWord` is a fixed 5-level ordinal scale: Unforgettable · Essential · Worth Revisiting · An Interesting Discovery · Not One I'd Revisit.
  - Three-tier catalog identity — `WineContract.id` is the **vintage** id, `wineLabelId` groups vintages; add `vintage` / `vintageDisplay`; `year` is now a deprecated optional alias.
  - Global origin — add `countryCode`, `appellation`, `color`, `grapeBlend` to wines; `RegionContract` hierarchy (`parentRegionId`, `regionType`, `countryCode`); new `AppellationContract`; `ProducerContract.countryCode`.
  - Unified trust vocabulary — `TrustTier` (professional · producer · distributor), `MemberStatus` (enthusiast → collector), `BusinessPersona` + `personaTier` mapping, and `MemberProfileType = MemberStatus | BusinessPersona` (renames "estate" → "producer"). New `TrustBylineContract`, `ProvenanceState`, `tierForProfile`.
  - Discover surfaces reshaped — `DiscoverSection` drops `regions`/`producers` in favour of `wines` (`WineContract[]`) and `doorways` (`DiscoverDoorwayContract` with a navigable `target`); adds `DiscoverWineHeroContract`, `WineActionContract`, `EditorialSubjectContract`/`EventSubjectContract` targeting, and `EventContract.host`. `WineListingContract` removed.
  - New `TastingNoteContract`, keyed to `wineVintageId` with distinct `tastedAt` / `createdAt`.

  **Breaking — `samples`**

  - Fixtures reshaped to the new contracts (no numeric `rating`), with global seeds (WO Stellenbosch · AOC Pauillac/Champagne · DOCG Barolo · Napa AVA, plus a non-vintage wine), new `appellations` and `tastingNotes` samples, and the discover fixture rebuilt to the Fade Yield funnel (editorial → wines → doorways → events → room).

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2b1f9d9: Restructure contracts into per-domain subpaths and make discover a composition contract.

  - New subpaths: `/catalog`, `/provenance`, `/editorial`, `/events`, `/social` (plus existing `/discover`, `/member`). `WineContract` and friends move from the package root to `/catalog` — the root now exports only `ApiResponse` and `PaginationContract`.
  - `PaginationDTO` renamed to `PaginationContract`.
  - Discover rewritten to the two-tier `DiscoverContract` (`{ hero, sections }`). The hero is a featured domain entity (`wine | region | editorial`) and sections carry domain-contract arrays. The old card and view-shaped hero types (`RegionCard`, `DiscoverWineHero`, `stats`, `ctas`, etc.) are removed — presentation now lives on the client.

  Breaking: every import path changes. Consumers move `WineContract` to `@edwardseshoka/contracts/catalog`, replace `DiscoverHomeResponse`/cards with `DiscoverContract` + domain contracts, and rename `PaginationDTO`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d46851d: Add member profile contract under the `@edwardseshoka/contracts/member` subpath.

  Exposes `MemberContract`, `MemberProfileType`, `MemberContactMethod`,
  `SaveMemberProfileRequest`, `GetMemberProfileResponse`, and
  `SaveMemberProfileResponse` as the single source of truth for the
  `GET/POST /user/profile` endpoints, shared by the backend Lambda handlers and
  the frontend member-data layer (including the member repository app double).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 030694a: Establish the first stable shared package releases.

  This promotes the shared contracts, fixtures, and foundation packages to the
  `1.x` line so app repositories can consume backward-compatible minor and patch
  updates with a semver range like `^1.0.0`, while future breaking changes remain
  manual app upgrades.

## 0.1.0

### Initial release

- Added the initial Morara shared contracts package.
